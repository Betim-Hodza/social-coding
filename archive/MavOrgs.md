Looking for our Club History? History of Mobi

About:

Discover the magic of making apps with Mobi! ü™Ñ
Mobi is a community-driven developer club based at the University of Texas at Arlington.

We strive to make an inclusive learning environment where students can come together to teach and learn from each other, such as in our weekly Social Coding events, Mobi Bytes, hackathons, and MavPitches.

Events:

Social Coding is a super beginner friendly way to get hands-on experience. Learn to code and even deploy your own app with others! There is complete creative freedom, so the coding wizards can show off their skills too! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Mobi Bytes are videos on our YouTube channel! These *byte* sized videos guarantee you gain a vital new tech skill for your next app.

Multiple Mobi members have gone on to start their own companies from the funds won at MavPitch

Mobi is active in the hackathon community, attending events across the state of Texas, with active members participating and mentoring in hackathons.
